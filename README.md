# Shazam_MATLAB
Helloo!!!
This Project is about implementing Shazam's Audio Fingerprinting Algorithm in Matlab

Follow these steps:
1) Create a Local Database of mp3 files
2) Go to makedatabase.m file and add the path of the folder in the script
3) SONGID.mat and HASHTABLE.mat files are created at the end.
4) Now your data-base is created
5) Cut a clip from any song in the database and add that to matchsegment.m 
6) Output will be the name of the original song

Places which can be worked on:
1) Noise Reduction is where i haven't stressed much
